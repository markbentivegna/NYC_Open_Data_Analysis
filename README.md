## Traffic Accident Dangers
Thanks to NYC Open Data, I was able to parse over 1.6 million traffic records. I was curious which features of traffic accidents have the highest rates involving human injuries. Taking into account only features with enough samples to be statistically significant, the leading features are: 
'''
    Bicycles
    101 East Drive, Brooklyn (Prospect Park Bouthouse)
    Scooters
    Illness
    Pedestrian Error
    West Drive (Central Park)
    West Drive (Prospect Park)
